---

## 0. Bugs / Immediately Fixable

### 0a. Docs reference `sp lift` — command is `sp respec`

`docs/reference/cli.md:15` lists `sp lift` which was the old name. The rename to `sp respec`
happened in Phase 4 but the docs weren't updated. Anyone reading the docs and trying `sp lift`
gets a confusing error.

### 0b. `validate_inputs()` is a placeholder

`src/specsoloist/schema.py:139` — `InterfaceSchema.validate_inputs()` has a body of `pass`.
This is called at runtime during `sp perform` to validate workflow step inputs.
Either implement it or raise `NotImplementedError` so failures are explicit rather than silent.

### 0c. Rich ANSI codes break CI/CD pipelines

Spinners and Rich markup render as garbage in GitHub Actions logs. A simple `--no-color`
flag (or auto-detection of `NO_COLOR` env var, which Rich supports natively) would make
`sp build` and `sp conduct` usable in scripted/CI contexts without visual noise.
Rich already has `Console(force_terminal=False)` for this — it's a one-liner.

### 0d. Missing docs for Arrangement, Docker sandbox, and agents

Three shipped features with zero user documentation:
- Arrangement system — no guide in docs/
- Docker sandboxing (`SPECSOLOIST_SANDBOX=true`) — mentioned nowhere in docs/
- Agent integration (`.claude/agents/`, `.gemini/agents/`) — no guide explaining how to use them

### 0e. `setup_commands` is parsed but never executed

`Arrangement.environment.setup_commands` is a first-class field in the schema — users can
write `setup_commands: [uv sync, npm install]` in their `arrangement.yaml` and it will
validate cleanly. But `runner.py` never reads it. The field silently does nothing.

This is worse than a missing feature: it's a documented field that promises behaviour the
code doesn't deliver. If a user's environment isn't already set up and they rely on
`setup_commands` to do it, compilation fails with an opaque error and they have no idea why.
Either execute them before running tests, or remove the field from the schema.

### 0g. `_compile_single_spec` doesn't skip reference specs from output file tracking

`core.py:_compile_single_spec()` (used by `sp build`) calls `compile_spec()`, which correctly
early-returns for `type: reference`. But the method then falls through to tracking output files
— it records a non-existent `mylib_interface.py` in the manifest. `sp status` handles this
correctly now (type-check before manifest lookup), but the manifest entry itself is wrong.

Fix: add `spec.metadata.type != "reference"` guard in `_compile_single_spec()` around the
output file tracking and `compile_tests()` call, matching the existing `typedef` exclusion.

Low priority — `sp conduct` (agent-first) bypasses `_compile_single_spec` entirely.

### 0h. Dict-style dep key mismatch in `reference_specs` lookup

In `core.py:compile_spec()`, reference deps are keyed by `dep.get("name", "")`. In
`compiler.py:_build_import_context()`, the lookup uses `dep.get("from", "")`. For dict deps
`{name: foo, from: bar}`, these keys could differ. In practice all current specs use
string-format deps, so this doesn't bite anyone — but it's a latent inconsistency.

Fix: normalise the key used in both places, or document which key is canonical.

### ~~0f. `--auto-accept` uses `bypassPermissions` too broadly~~ ✅ Fixed

`_run_agent_oneshot()` now uses `--dangerously-skip-permissions` for all `--auto-accept` runs.
The `bypassPermissions` mode and the `is_quine` permission branch have been removed entirely —
`bypassPermissions` and `--dangerously-skip-permissions` are functionally equivalent in the
current Claude CLI, and the quine's real sandbox is the output path (`build/quine/`) plus the
agent prompt, not the permission mode.

Still worth considering: `--allowedTools` or `--allowed-paths` for finer-grained directory
scoping if Claude CLI exposes that cleanly in a future version.

---

## 1. Quick Wins (Low effort, high value)

### 1a. `sp doctor` — Pre-flight diagnostic command ✅ Done

The most common failure mode for new users is a missing API key or no agent CLI installed.
A single command that checks everything would eliminate this entire class of support issues:

```
sp doctor

  ✓ ANTHROPIC_API_KEY set
  ✗ GEMINI_API_KEY not set
  ✓ claude CLI found (Claude Code 1.2.3)
  ✗ gemini CLI not found
  ✓ Docker available (will use sandbox mode)
  ✓ uv available
  ✓ Python 3.12 (meets >=3.10 requirement)
  ✓ 4 specs found in src/
```

### 1b. `sp status` — Show compilation state of each spec ✅ Done

Right now there's no way to see at a glance what's compiled, stale, or broken:

```
sp status

  Spec            Compiled    Tests    Last Built
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────
  config          ✓           ✓        2h ago
  resolver        ✓           ✗ FAIL   2h ago
  parser          stale        -        4d ago
  my_new_spec     never        -        -
```

This would just read the build manifest. The data is already there.

### 1c. Fix pytest collection warnings

Two known warnings in the test suite:
- `TestResult` class in `runner.py` confuses pytest collection
- `TestRunner` class in `runner.py` has `__init__` so pytest skips it

Neither is harmful but they're noise in every test run. Rename them to `_TestResult` / `_TestRunner`
or use a `# noqa` hint if renaming breaks the spec.

### 1d. Fix the quine naming mismatch

The quine generates `speccomposer.py` / `specconductor.py` but the originals are
`composer.py` / `conductor.py`. Either:
- Rename the originals to match what the quine produces (quine is the authority), or
- Update the score specs to instruct soloists to use the shorter names

This is a correctness issue for quine validation — right now the quine passes but produces
differently-named files, which makes semantic comparison harder.

### 1e. `sp init` — Scaffold a new project ★★★ (raised priority)

```bash
sp init my-project
sp init my-project --arrangement typescript   # pick a template
```

Creates:
```
my-project/
  specs/          # where specs go
  arrangement.yaml
  .gitignore
```

This is the natural entry point for using SpecSoloist within an existing project
(e.g. importing it into a FastHTML or Next.js app for spec-driven development).
Currently new users have to discover the directory convention by reading docs.

### 1h. Interface and adapter spec examples — fasthtml_app ✅ Done; Next.js pending

SpecSoloist has no documented pattern for external dependencies. Three patterns exist
and should be illustrated with real examples:

1. **Constraints only** — for well-known libraries (React, pytest); just mention in arrangement
2. **Reference spec** — for obscure/new libraries (FastHTML, custom SDKs); write a `type: reference`
   spec describing the subset of the external API you use, so soloists have accurate docs
3. **Adapter spec** — for complex SDKs (Vercel AI); wrap the SDK in a spec'd adapter so
   the rest of your project is isolated from the SDK's API surface

`examples/fasthtml_app/` is end-to-end validated (23 tests passing). `fasthtml_interface.spec.md`
is now properly `type: reference` with `# Overview`, `# API`, and `# Verification` sections
(migrated as part of task 04 — it was previously `type: bundle` which was a semantic misfit).

Remaining example to add (tracked as task 07):
- `examples/nextjs-ai-chat/` — Next.js app with a `vercel_ai_interface.spec.md` reference spec
  wrapping the Vercel AI SDK

These are higher-value examples than the current math/string demos and directly address
the real-world use case of adopting SpecSoloist in an existing project.

### 1f. Remove `sp perform` or finish it

`sp perform` executes workflow specs but the workflow spec type is not well-documented
and `perform()` in `conductor.py` has placeholder-quality implementation (including
`validate_inputs()` which is a `pass` stub). It either needs a proper spec, integration
tests, and documentation — or it should be removed before it creates support burden.
Half-finished features erode trust in the tool.

### 1g. `--quiet` / `--json` output flags for scripting

No way to suppress Rich terminal output or get machine-readable results.
Downstream tooling (Makefiles, CI scripts, editor integrations) needs clean output.

```bash
sp build --quiet       # only emit errors
sp status --json       # JSON-formatted state for editor extensions to parse
```

Rich has `Console(quiet=True)` and the data structures are already Pydantic models,
so JSON serialization is trivial.

---

## 2. Developer Experience

### 2a. Watch mode — `sp watch`

```bash
sp watch              # recompile any spec that changes
sp watch resolver     # watch a specific spec
```

Uses `watchdog` or `inotify`. Detects when a `.spec.md` changes and kicks off
`sp compile <name>` automatically. Essential for rapid iteration.

### 2b. Streaming compilation output

Right now compilation shows a spinner and then dumps the result. When you're paying
attention to what the agent is doing, seeing the output stream in real time is much better.
This is more of a UX polish item but the difference in feel is significant.

### 2c. `sp diff <name>` — Show what changed

After recompiling a spec, show a diff of the generated code vs the previous version.
Helps developers understand what the agent actually changed and catch regressions
before they hit tests.

### 2d. Better `--no-agent` first-run experience

The direct LLM path (`--no-agent`) is the fallback for users without Claude/Gemini CLI.
Currently it requires an API key but gives poor feedback if the key is wrong or the
model call fails. The error paths should be as polished as the happy path.

---

## 3. The Quine & Score (Self-Hosting)

### 3a. `quine_diff` — Semantic fidelity tool (spec exists, not implemented)

`score/quine_diff.spec.md` already exists. The spec is written; it just needs a soloist
to compile it. This is a great opportunity for SpecSoloist to eat its own cooking —
run `sp compile quine_diff`, then use the output. A natural first task for Phase 8.

After running `sp conduct score/`, compare the quine output against the original source:
- Function signatures match?
- Public API is a superset of the spec?
- Test count is reasonable?
- Any functions in the original that aren't in the quine?

This turns the quine from a binary pass/fail into a useful diagnostic tool.

### 3b. `conduct_quine_python.sh` convenience script + quine arrangement

A `scripts/conduct_quine_python.sh` wrapper that runs `sp conduct score/ --model haiku --auto-accept`
with the right environment. Should reference (or create) an `arrangements/quine_python.yaml`
that pins output paths, the Python arrangement, and the `build/quine/` target — so the quine
is fully reproducible without flags.

### 3c. Quine CI — nightly self-hosting run

Add a scheduled GitHub Actions workflow that runs `sp conduct score/` nightly and
reports pass rate. If the quine degrades (specs drift from source), you know immediately.
This is the canary for spec quality.

### 3c. Score freshness check

When you modify `src/specsoloist/foo.py`, the corresponding `score/foo.spec.md`
may now be out of date. A `sp score check` command (or a hook in `sp build`) could
compare spec-described API against actual implementation and warn about drift.

This is the inverse of what soloists do: instead of spec → code, it's code → "does the
spec still describe this?"

---

## 4. Spec Format & Language

### 4a. Spec inheritance / extension

```yaml
---
name: authenticated_api
extends: base_api
type: bundle
---
```

Allows specs to inherit common patterns (auth, pagination, error handling) from a base spec.
Reduces duplication in large projects where every endpoint needs the same error contract.

### 4b. Spec versioning

Track which version of a spec produced the current compiled artifact. When a spec changes,
flag any downstream specs that might need recompilation (the dependency graph already knows
what depends on what).

Format: a `version` field in frontmatter, stored in the manifest.

### 4c. Better bundle format for large modules

Bundles are great for small groups of functions but get unwieldy at 15+ items.
Consider a `section` divider within bundles, or a size heuristic that suggests splitting.

### 4d. `sp validate` quality checks (beyond structure) ✅ Done

Currently validates spec *structure* (required fields, valid type, etc.).
Add quality hints:
- "No examples provided — soloists compile better with concrete examples"
- "Spec has no schema block — interface contract is underspecified"
- "Description is very short — consider expanding edge cases"

These are warnings, not errors. But they'd significantly improve compile quality.

### 4e. `reference` spec type for third-party API documentation ✅ Done (2026-03-11)

Implemented in task 04. A reference spec documents a third-party library's API without
generating any implementation code. The spec body is injected as context into the prompts
of dependent soloists.

**Required sections:** `# Overview` (library name, package, version range, import path),
`# API` (prose or tables of the external API). **Recommended:** `# Verification` — a code
snippet compiled to `tests/test_{name}.py` that runs against the real installed library,
catching API drift.

`examples/fasthtml_app/specs/fasthtml_interface.spec.md` migrated from `type: bundle`
(a semantic misfit) to `type: reference` with all three sections present.

**Validation behaviour:** `sp validate` shows `type: reference — context only`; warns if
`# Verification` absent or no version range in `# Overview`. `sp status` shows `CONTEXT`/`—`
instead of looking up the manifest.

### 4f. Multi-spec design for web apps: separate routing from layout

Surfaced during `examples/fasthtml_app/` validation. The single `app.spec.md` mixes
route logic and page layout, which caused a real gap: the spec defined `DELETE /todos/{index}`
as a route but never specified that `GET /` should render a delete button per todo item.
The tests passed (the route exists), but the UI was incomplete.

Better decomposition for any non-trivial web app:

```
specs/
  layout.spec.md   — page skeleton, reusable components (Header, TodoItem with delete button)
  routes.spec.md   — route handlers, depends on layout
  state.spec.md    — data model (todos list), pure logic
```

This way a spec reviewer can catch the missing delete button by reading `layout.spec.md`
alone, without cross-referencing route definitions. The `app.spec.md` Test Scenarios section
should also be updated to include a UI-level scenario: "Home page renders a delete button
for each todo item."

Worth noting in the fasthtml_app README and using as the pattern recommendation in docs.

---

## 5. Multi-Language

### 5a. TypeScript / Node.js ✅ Validated (2026-03-09)

`sp conduct examples/ts_demo/src/ --arrangement arrangements/arrangement.typescript.yaml`
works end-to-end with Gemini CLI: environment setup (package.json, tsconfig.json, npm install),
code generation, and tests via Vitest all pass. See `examples/ts_demo/` and
`arrangements/arrangement.typescript.yaml`.

Remaining gap: no example arrangements for web frameworks (Next.js, Fastify, etc.) and
no documentation in `docs/`. The path is proven; building on it is next.

### 5b. Multi-language quine

Run `sp conduct score/` with `target_language: typescript` and get working TypeScript.
This would prove the spec format is truly language-agnostic and is a strong marketing
narrative.

### 5c. Go and Rust

Longer-term. Both languages benefit enormously from correct-by-construction patterns
(strong typing, explicit error handling). Specs would map very naturally to Go interfaces
and Rust traits. But start with TypeScript first.

---

## 6. Agent & LLM Providers

### 6a. OpenAI / GPT provider

The `LLMProvider` abstraction exists. Adding OpenAI would make SpecSoloist accessible
to a much larger audience (many developers have OpenAI credits but not Anthropic/Google).

### 6b. Local LLMs via Ollama

`ollama run llama3` as a provider for:
- Privacy-sensitive projects (no data leaves the machine)
- Cost-conscious users
- Offline use

Quality will be lower but for simple specs it may be sufficient.

### 6c. Provider cost/token tracking

Show token usage after each compilation:
```
Compiled resolver in 12s  (2,847 tokens, est. $0.003)
```

Especially useful for `sp conduct` runs where you're compiling 15 specs in parallel
and costs add up. Log totals to the manifest.

### 6d. Model pinning in arrangement files

```yaml
model: claude-haiku-4-5-20251001  # fast/cheap for leaf specs
```

Combined with cost tracking, this lets teams make deliberate cost/quality tradeoffs
per-spec without using global config.

---

## 7. Testing & Quality

### 7a. Spec coverage metric

Analogous to test coverage: what % of the exported symbols in a compiled module
are described in its spec? Run via static analysis of the generated code.

```
sp coverage

  parser.py:       87% spec coverage (3 functions undocumented)
  resolver.py:    100% spec coverage
  compiler.py:     61% spec coverage  ← needs attention
```

### 7b. Snapshot testing for generated code

After successful compilation, store a hash of the generated code. On recompilation,
if the hash changes significantly (not just whitespace), prompt the developer to review
the diff before accepting. Prevents silent regressions where a spec is subtly mis-compiled.

### 7c. `sp test --all` with summary reporting ✅ Done (task 02)

Implemented. `sp test --all` runs tests for every compiled spec and shows a results table.

---

## 8. Infrastructure & Distribution

### 8a. Homebrew formula

```bash
brew install specsoloist
```

Reaches developers who don't use pip. Homebrew is the first-class installation path
for many macOS/Linux developers for CLI tools. Low effort to maintain once set up.

### 8b. Official Docker image

```bash
docker run ghcr.io/symbolfarm/specsoloist sp conduct src/
```

Useful for CI pipelines where you don't want to install Python. The sandbox Dockerfile
already exists — a wrapper image for the CLI itself is a small step from there.

### 8c. `.specsoloist/` project directory

Currently build artifacts are scattered:
- `.specsoloist-manifest.json` in project root
- `.spechestra/traces/` for workflow traces
- `build/quine/` for quine output

Consolidating under `.specsoloist/` makes the tool feel more intentional:
```
.specsoloist/
  manifest.json
  build/
  traces/
  cache/
```

A minor cleanup but it signals that the tool is mature and respects your project root.

### 8d. Build progress dashboard (uvicorn + SSE)

A lightweight local server (`sp serve`?) that conductor and soloists push events to,
rendered as a live dashboard in the browser. The key design question is the event API:
conductor and soloists would need a structured way to emit `spec_started`, `spec_passed`,
`spec_failed`, `build_complete` events — probably a simple HTTP POST to localhost or a
shared queue.

Worth considering: tmux-based agent management (used by at least one similar project)
as an alternative to a server — agents run in named panes, progress is visible in terminal
without a browser. Both approaches are valid; the server approach is more composable
(webhooks, remote monitoring, future CI integration).

This is a meaningful architectural decision — the event API shapes how conductor spawns
soloists and how results are surfaced. Park until web app examples are working in
production and we have a clearer picture of real monitoring needs.

### 8e. Windows support audit

Is `sp` tested on Windows? The path handling (`os.path.join`, etc.) should be fine,
but runner subprocess commands may not be. Worth a CI matrix run.

---

## 9. Collaboration & Ecosystem

### 9a. VS Code extension

The highest-leverage distribution play. An extension could provide:
- Syntax highlighting for `.spec.md` files
- Preview pane showing compiled code alongside spec
- "Compile Spec" code action
- Inline errors from `sp validate`
- Status bar showing compilation state

This lowers the barrier to entry significantly — you get the full experience without
knowing any CLI commands.

### 9b. Spec registry (longer term)

An npm-like registry where developers share reusable specs:
```bash
sp install specsoloist/rest-api-patterns
sp install specsoloist/auth-patterns
```

Shared specs for common patterns (pagination, authentication, error handling, CRUD).
This creates a community around the format and accelerates adoption.

### 9c. GitHub App / PR checks

A GitHub App that:
- Runs `sp validate` on changed specs in PRs
- Posts a comment if specs are structurally invalid
- (Optional) Runs `sp compile` in a sandbox and posts the diff

Makes spec quality a first-class part of code review without requiring team members
to run the tool locally.

### 9d. Example project gallery

A `specsoloist/examples` repo with 3-5 complete projects built with SpecSoloist:
- A REST API (Python + FastAPI)
- A CLI tool
- A data pipeline
- A TypeScript web service (once TS support is solid)

Nothing convinces developers like seeing a real working thing they can clone.

---

## 10. Strategic / Philosophical

### 10a. The "live spec" concept

Right now specs are compiled once. What if a running service could reflect on its own
spec at runtime? Error messages that reference the spec. Auto-generated API docs
that are always in sync because they come from the spec, not the code.

This is a bigger idea but it's the natural endpoint of "specs are the source of truth."

### 10b. Spec-first API design

Integration with OpenAPI/Swagger: convert an OpenAPI spec to SpecSoloist format,
then compile to a server implementation. Or vice versa — generate OpenAPI from
SpecSoloist specs. This bridges spec-driven development and API-first development.

### 10c. The "upgrade" workflow

When you upgrade a library (say, from FastAPI 0.100 to 0.115), the generated code
may be outdated. `sp upgrade` could:
1. Note which specs produce code using the old API
2. Recompile those specs with the new library version in the arrangement
3. Show the diff

This makes dependency upgrades much less painful in large spec-driven projects.

### 10d. Spec migration format versioning

The spec format itself may need to evolve. Adding a `spec_version: 1.0` field to
frontmatter now means we can write migrations later (like Rails migrations, but for
specs). Without this, future format changes will break existing spec files silently.
